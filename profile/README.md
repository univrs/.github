# Univrs.io Roadmap

### A startup focused on advocating for the US Government to build and maintain a public cloud infrastructure could be quite a challenging yet ambitious endeavor. Hereâ€™s a high-level roadmap to help you get started:

### 1. Conduct Thorough Research
Understand the landscape of cloud computing, current government policies on technology and cloud infrastructure, and the various stakeholders involved. Focus on these areas:
- **Existing Government Cloud Services**: Study existing public cloud services, like those provided by AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, as well as government cloud initiatives like FedRAMP.
- **Legislation & Policy**: Look into current laws and policies related to technology and infrastructure. Understand any regulatory hurdles you might face.

### 2. Develop a Clear Value Proposition
Articulate why creating a publicly funded cloud infrastructure is beneficial. Consider the following points:
- **Economic Impact**: Demonstrate how widespread access to cloud resources can drive innovation, create jobs, and support new business models.
- **Equity and Access**: Show how this initiative can democratize access to technology, making it accessible to underrepresented and underserved communities.
- **Security and Sovereignty**: Argue how a US Government-managed cloud can enhance national security and data sovereignty.

### 3. Build a Strong Team
Assemble a team with diverse expertise, including:
- **Technical Experts**: Engineers, cloud architects, and IT professionals who understand cloud infrastructure.
- **Policy Advocates**: Individuals experienced in working with government agencies and understanding federal procurement.
- **Legal Advisors**: Lawyers who specialize in technology, intellectual property, and public policy.
- **Business Strategists**: Professionals with experience in startups, particularly those dealing with large-scale infrastructure projects.

### 4. Create a Business Plan
A solid business plan should cover:
- **Mission and Vision**: What you aim to achieve and how it aligns with broader societal goals.
- **Roadmap & Milestones**: Key stages of development, from initial advocacy to full-scale implementation.
- **Funding Strategy**: Potential sources of funding, including grants, private investors, or partnerships with established cloud service providers.
- **Partnerships & Alliances**: Potential collaborators within the tech industry, civil society, academia, and government agencies.

### 5. Engage Stakeholders & Build Alliances
Form alliances with relevant stakeholders:
- **Government Officials**: Approach policymakers and legislators who could champion your cause.
- **Technology Organizations**: Partner with tech advocacy groups, think tanks, and industry bodies.
- **Community Organizations**: Engage with grassroots organizations and civil rights groups to build broad-based support.

### 6. Advocacy and Lobbying
Create a robust advocacy plan:
- **Public Campaigns**: Raise awareness about your initiative through public relations campaigns, social media, and community events.
- **Policy Proposals**: Draft detailed policy proposals and white papers to present to government officials and policymakers.

### 7. Pilot Projects and Demonstrations
Run pilot projects to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of a publicly funded cloud.
- **Proof of Concept**: Develop small-scale prototypes or community-driven cloud projects as a proof of concept.
- **Case Studies**: Highlight successful case studies where public cloud access has driven innovation and business creation.

### 8. Fundraising
Secure funding through multiple channels:
- **Public Grants and Funding**: Apply for government grants and public funding initiatives.
- **Private Investments**: Seek venture capital or angel investments.

### 9. Continuous Feedback and Adaptation
Incorporate feedback and stay adaptable:
- **Community Engagement**: Maintain active communication with the developer and business communities to adapt to their needs.
- **Iterative Development**: Continuously improve your proposal based on stakeholder feedback and technological advancements.

### Example Resources
- **GovLoop**: A social network connecting government officials and providing resources for public sector innovation ([GovLoop Website](https://www.govloop.com/))
- **FedRAMP**: Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, which provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud services ([FedRAMP Website](https://www.fedramp.gov/))
- **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)**: Guidelines and standards for cloud computing ([NIST Cloud Computing](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/nist-cloud-computing-program))

## **"An appeal to Principles is the condition of any considerable reconstruction of society, because social institutions are the visible expression of the scale of moral values which rules the minds of individuals, and it is impossible to alter institutions without altering that moral valuation."**

(doesnâ€™t mean you always side with them, but they need to help keep you out of ditches).
23. Donâ€™t underestimate relationship management.
24. Invest in a champion there, a bit of an overhead position but someone who knows the domain, communicates well and has your trust.
25. Measure as much as possible what makes sense to measure, use self-analysis & quality improvements for everything else.
